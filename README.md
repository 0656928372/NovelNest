## Known Limitations / Notes

- Reader works best with plain text or clean HTML formats
- Some very old books have formatting quirks in plain text
- No offline support yet (Service Worker could be added later)
- LocalStorage favorites are per-browser/device only
- Gutendex sometimes returns partial results — API is very reliable though

## Future Ideas

- Add light/dark mode toggle
- Offline caching of book metadata & covers (PWA)
- Reading progress tracking
- Category / collection browsing
- Export favorites as JSON/CSV
- Multiple language support beyond English
